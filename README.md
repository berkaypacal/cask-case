## üì¶ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/berkaypacal/cask-case.git
cd cask-case

npm install
# or
yarn
```

---

## üìÑ Environment Variables

After cloning the repository, create a `.env` file manually in the project root directory:

```env
BASE_URL=https://example-cask-api-url.com
SCOPE=
ADMMDLID=
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The `.env` file is required for the app to run properly and must be manually created after cloning the repo. Ensure it is not committed by verifying it's listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

```bash
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

Don't forget to start Metro:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

## üîî Push Notification Flow

1. FCM token is retrieved and displayed.
2. User picks the PN type (1 - Text, 2 - Image, 3 - YouTube).
3. Sends a request to the backend via `/api`.
4. Notification is handled (foreground/background).
5. Based on `pn_type`, navigates to the corresponding screen.

## Known Issues

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **YouTube Video Playback**
  - Some YouTube videos may **not play inside the app** due to the video owner's settings that **disable embedding** on third-party applications.
  - This is **not a bug** in the application.
  - As a workaround, users can manually open the video link in their browser or the YouTube app.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **iOS Push Notification Support**
  - Firebase project configuration is provided and managed by **Cask**.
  - Therefore, iOS-specific notification permissions and behavior **could not be verified or tested**.
  - The current implementation is focused on **Android support**.
